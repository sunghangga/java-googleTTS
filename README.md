# Free Google-TTS for Java 

On Eclipse you have to add jl1.0.jar to your Java Build Path.

On your shell you can start the runnable JAR file:
```sh
java -jar tts.jar "<language>" "<text>"

java -jar tts.jar "En-us" "It works! Foo!"
```

I think there are all languages available. For example: En-us, DE-de, ...

You can get the lastest runnable Jar file
